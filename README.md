# Course Project

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool. All CSS files should be written in a `css/` folder, while all JavaScript files should be created in a `js/` folder.

Once you create a `gh-pages` branch, the site can be viewed at <https://info340d-au18.github.io/project-YOUR_USER_NAME/>.
