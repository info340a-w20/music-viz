    <h1>Project: Anything Is Possible</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Topic Description</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Provide an overview of the general topic 
                (e.g., What election is coming up, and why is it important?)
            </li>
            <li>Justify the creation of any applications in that domain 
                (e.g., What information problems are currently unaddressed,
                relating to the election?).

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>For our general topic, we want to do something related to music and how people 
                    learn about music. We are both musicians and like to listen to a lot of music, 
                    so we thought that this topic would be interesting and allow us to be somewhat 
                    creative with our project. It is important that people continue making music 
                    and artists can share their songs. There are plenty of platforms for people to 
                    share music, but there are less about learning and understanding how music 
                    works and how it is structured. We think that this problem space will allow 
                    people to obtain a better understanding and help make their listening and 
                    learning experiences better.

                <h3>Justification</h3>
                <p>
                    Music is a big part of people’s life. It is a form of recreation and remedy to 
                    many. Billions of music is being streamed everyday, and because of this, we 
                    want to create some applications that will help enhance the overall experience 
                    of listening to music. Furthermore, the music is not just about listening but 
                    also learning and playing as a form of social gathering and personal hobbies. 
                    Because of this, we want to better both aspects of music, learning and 
                    listening, in our project.

        <h2>Potential Web Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Music Visualizer</h3>
                <p>
                    Our first idea is an interactive music visualizer. Through this web app a user 
                    could choose a song and see how a computer analyzes the different pitches and 
                    waves. This is often how people make beats and mixes of songs, and 
                    visualizations can help people understand the different parts of a track. Users 
                    would be able to take away certain parts of a song like the bass or the vocals 
                    and see how the song changes in both sound and visual pattern. Users would also 
                    be able to choose how the visualization looks. This would include options like 
                    colors and shapes of the graph.

                <h3>Chord Search</h3>
                <p>
                    Our second idea is a chord search. This web app will allow users to 
                    input/select the chords that they know (preferably guitar/piano) and then the 
                    website will output the songs that is playable with the chords that they are 
                    able to play. A lot of people, when trying to learn music would like to play 
                    something to keep the motivation and fun in learning. And most of the time 
                    they don’t know any songs that they can play with the chords that they know so 
                    resorting to playing and rehearsing the same old group of songs. With this, we 
                    can give them more options to choose from and also encourage them to learn 1 
                    or 2 more chords to unlock more songs that they can play as a result. The web 
                    app will have display of chord
                </p>
